# Spotify Playlist to MP3 files

Reads names of the songs in your public Spotify Playlist and downloads them using yt_dlp

## Prerequisites 

The Main.py needs a secret client key and client key from the user and it needs to be done manually.
1. Go to [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and go to dashboard.**WARNING! Your account may get suspended so use spare account for this.**

2. Create an app, set the uri as https://localhost:8000/callback and select Web API in the checkbox below

3. Copy the secret client key and client key.

**The user also must have FFmpeg in their system**  .

```bash
#windows, in powershell
winget install ffmpeg

#macOS
brew install ffmpeg

#linux ubuntu (use your respective package manager)
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```



## Setting up the script

1. Make sure to download both Main.py and requirements.txt and put them in an empty folder
2. Go to line 8 in Main.py and paste the client secret key.
```python
client_secret = 'paste_it_here'
client_id = 'paste_it_here'
```
2. Next, create a virual python env using terminal. This creates a folder (virtual environmet) called spotify .
```bash
python -m venv spotify
```
3. Move both Main.py and requirements.txt into it

## Running the script

1. Activate the virtual. **You need to do this each time you want to run the code**.
```bash
# for windows

spotify\Scripts\activate

# for linux/macOS
source spotify/bin/activate
```
2. Change directory into spotify folder and download required python packages, **you only need to do this once**.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Main.py to get started. The songs will be downloaded into a folder named Downloads within the spotify folder automatically.

4. Deactivate the v_env once you are done.
```bash
deactivate
```
